                          the Christian Church is what different 
                          Christian denominations conceive of as being the true body 
                          of Christians or the original institution established by
                           Jesus. Christian Church has also been used in academia 
                           as a synonym for Christianity, despite the fact that
                           it is composed of multiple churches or denominations,
                           many of which hold a doctrinal claim of being 
                           the one true church to the exclusion of the others.
                           For many Protestant Christians, the Christian Church has two components
                           : the church visible, institutions in which 
                           the Word of God purely preached and listened to,
                           and the sacraments administered according to Christ's
                            institution as well as the church invisible—all who are 
                            truly saved (with these beings members of 
                            the visible church). In this understanding of
                            the invisible church, "Christian Church" 
                            (or catholic Church) does not refer to a particular Christian
                            denomination, but includes all individuals who have been
                            saved. The branch theory, which is maintained by some
                            Anglicans, holds that those Churches that have preserve
                            apostolic succession are part of the true Church.
                            This is in contrast to the one true church applied
                            to a specific concrete Christian institution,
                            a Christian ecclesiological position maintained
                            by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church,
                            the Oriental Orthodox churches, Assyrian Church of 
                            the East and the Ancient Church of the East.
                            Most English translations of the New Testament 
                            generally use the word church as a translation
                            of the Ancient Greek ἐκκλησία 
                            (romanized ecclesia), found in the original
                            Greek texts, which generally meant an 
                            "assembly" or "congregation".
                            This term appears in two verses of the Gospel
                            of Matthew, 24 verses of the Acts of the
                            Apostles, 58 verses of the Pauline 
                            epistles (including the earliest instances
                            of its use in relation to a Christian 
                            body), two verses of the Letter to the 
                            Hebrews, one verse of the Epistle of 
                            James, three verses of the Third Epistle 
                            of John, and 19 verses of the Book of
                            Revelation. In total, ἐκκλησία appears 
                            in the New Testament text 114 times, 
                            although not every instance is a 
                            technical reference to the church.
                            As such it is used for local communities
                            as well as in a universal sense to
                            mean all believers. The earliest 
                            recorded use of the term Christianity
                            (Greek: Χριστιανισμός) was by 
                            Ignatius of Antioch, in around 100
                            AD.</p>
